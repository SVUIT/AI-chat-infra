## Objectives

The main objective of the project is to help students easily find information and documents about the subject of University of Information technology - VNUHCM, especially to be able to refer to real projects by alumni. We aim for students of all cohorts to be able to transfer and share knowledge with each other through this platform.

Due to limited human resources, we currently only focus on documents of the Faculty of Computer Networks and Communications.
