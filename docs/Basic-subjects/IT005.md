## Other information

- This can be said to be one of the most important subjects for students majoring in Networking, the knowledge of this subject is closely related to many subjects in the following semesters.
- For the Data link layer content, you can refer to the review blog at [https://thu4n.dev/posts/data-link-layer/](https://thu4n.dev/posts/data-link-layer/)
- The theoretical content is relatively long, leading to easy forgetting of some small parts (and the test likes to ask about those small parts), you should spend a lot of time reviewing if you want a high score.
